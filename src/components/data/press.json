      "subtitle": " It is hard to deny the beauty of successfully blending old and new. Taking the best of the past and marrying it with the benefits of the present almost always produces something close to, if not, perfect. In Europe, buildings often outlive generations and remind us of times gone by. In the United States, a building is considered old after a few years and often becomes deemed teardown-worthy within a few decades. But when buildings are built well, technologically and design-wise, it is hard to deny their value. Renovating old is the new trend that New Yorkers should celebrate.",

      "summary": "THE BELNORD: The Belnord is an iconic Upper West Side landmark that occupies an entire city block bounded by West 86th and 87th Streets, Amsterdam Avenue and Broadway. Robert A.M. Stern Architects, the world-renowned architecture firm, is overseeing the restoration of the original architecture and re- imagining the interiors for the residences. Originally designed by Hiss & Weekes and originally constructed in 1908, the Belnord is a superb example of a turn-of-the-century residential building. The 140-story property’s new design will feature 95 residences, ranging from two- to five-bedrooms. In addition, 9,000 square feet of state-of-the-art amenities will be incorporated into the building, and many of The Belnord’s hallmarks – including the courtyard and the exterior architecture – will be restored to their original grandeur with updated features.\r\n",

      "summary": "In one important way, condominiums had a banner year in 2017. Though closings were about par for the course and contract volume was nothing to write home about, a single Manhattan building finally crossed the $4 billion threshold. Thanks to a familiar face, 2017 gave us the most expensive condo building in Manhattan history, when Gary Barnett’s Central Park Tower was approved to hit the market at $4 billion. The eye-popping total exceeded its limestone rival at 220 Central Park South by about $600 million. Despite a sagging luxury market, Barnett and a handful of other developers are shooting for ambitious sellouts. Appearing on this list are Bizzi & Partners’ long-delayed supertall at 125 Greenwich Street, the Elad Group and Peebles Corporation’s drama- soaked Clock Tower conversion in Tribeca, and HFZ Capital’s conversion of the historic Belnord on the Upper West Side. After Central Park Tower, the prices drop off quickly. HFZ’s Belnord conversion was the only other condo project with a targeted price tag above $1 billion in 2017, with a projected sellout of $1.35 billion. Following that, a trio of waterfront condo towers at GID Development’s Waterline Square have a combined sellout of $1.15 billion, and two of the condo towers made the list independently. Here is the full list of the most valuable condo offering plans accepted by the New York State Attorney General’s office in 2017.",

It was long known as 346 Broadway. But now that the building is being converted to condominiums, it is being marketed as 108 Leonard Street instead.",

After a meticulous facade restoration by Howard L. Zimmerman Architects, the landmarked Clock Tower Building at 108 Leonard Street in New York's TriBeCa neighborhood has been transformed by architect Jeffrey Beers into more than 150 residences. Opening in early 2019, the building posed such interior challenges as a landmarked Italian Renaissance Revival lobby and atypical interior configuration, but Beers set out with a goal in mind: \"Complement the history of the building and contrast it harmoniously\" with contemporary details.",

    "para": "Perched atop the handsomely restored neoclassical building stands an exclusive portfolio of eleven one-of-a-kind homes. All offer owners the most desirable amenities of a city residence: theatrical volumes, grand master suites, cosseting fireplaces and majestic vistas. Then these artfully-designed retreats amplify the luxury, providing rare features—from ceiling heights worthy of a palace to deep patios that evoke the feeling of a lush secret garden—unique to each unit."

    "para": "Perched atop the handsomely restored neoclassical building stands an exclusive portfolio of eleven one-of-a-kind homes. All offer owners the most desirable amenities of a city residence: theatrical volumes, grand master suites, cosseting fireplaces and majestic vistas. Then these artfully-designed retreats amplify the luxury, providing rare features—from ceiling heights worthy of a palace to deep patios that evoke the feeling of a lush secret garden—unique to each unit. Three exceptionally-scaled penthouse residences take their cue from the building’s pinnacle architectural adornment, with sweeping wrap terraces, grand staircases and beautifully-scaled layouts. Apartments as ample and elegant as the Crown Collection are near-impossible to find elsewhere in New York City."

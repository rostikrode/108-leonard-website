    "title": "Romancing Downtown",
    "para": "In a nod to this distinguished Italian Renaissance building and its Parisian counterparts, Jeffrey Beers juxtaposes classic details—oversized moldings, chevron-patterned oak floors—with contemporary touches for these 169 highly-appointed residences. Particularly high ceilings ranging from 12 to more than 15 feet, original restored windows and five inch wide oak floors bring authentic European glamour to organically flowing layouts. Gallery walls are awash in lighting tucked behind recessed coves, offering illuminated spaces for burgeoning art collectors. Open-plan kitchens have been thoughtfully conceived in two palettes, Ash or Sand, sheathed in marble backsplashes and anchored by stunning marble waterfall islands and top-of-the-line appliances. Each residence has been optimized for space and warmth. From the outside, 108 Leonard is historic landmark that pays homage to a gilded bygone era; on the inside, it is a bright canvas of modern restraint, ready to adapt to one’s individual lifestyle."
